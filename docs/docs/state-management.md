# State Management

We chose **React Query** for managing the state of our app because it handles:

- Data fetching, caching, and synchronization automatically.
- Automatic retries and background fetching to ensure that the data is always up-to-date.
- Minimal boilerplate code.

React Query helps manage the lifecycle of our API requests and provides an easy-to-use API for data fetching.
