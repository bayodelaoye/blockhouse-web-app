# Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Handling data fetching and caching efficiently.
  **Solution**: I used React Query to manage data fetching and caching, which reduced the complexity of manually handling state and refetching data.

- **Challenge**: Implementing a search bar that filters the cryptocurrency list.
  **Solution**: I used local state to manage the search term and filtered the cryptocurrency list dynamically.

- **Challenge**: Creating an animation to display a loading effect when fetching the cryptocurrencies.
  **Solution**: I used framer motion and useEffect hook to set a timeoutof 3 seconds so that the loading animation can be viewed.
